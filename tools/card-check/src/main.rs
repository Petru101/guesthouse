//! `guesthouse-card-check`: one program for anyone with an NVIDIA card, to find out what Guesthouse
//! would make of it. It reads the card through controls that only read, says what the app knows of
//! it, and then, if asked, tries the channels a VM would use. It writes one file to post.
//!
//! It needs no root, no Rust and no Windows driver. It changes nothing on the system: the objects it
//! makes in the driver go when it ends.
